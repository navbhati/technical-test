  "body": "#Introduction\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to do the Microlise ATD technical test. Experts in mobile asset and resource optimisation, Microliseâ€™s mission is to empower our customers to reduce their costs and environmental impact by maximising the efficiency of their transportation operations. To achieve this we will continue to develop and deploy innovative, industry-leading technology solutions and services that enable our customers to optimise fleet utilisation and driver performance, to reduce costs and to improve service delivery.\r\n\r\nWe would like you to take a look at the Microlise website. You can find it here: http://www.microlise.com/\r\n\r\nUsing a test framework of your choice, in C#, write three tests that you think provide the best coverage of Advanced Search functionality that can be found at the bottom the Resources page of the above website.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this test, please raise an issue against this repo, and one of the team member will answer your query as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n###When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:\r\n\r\n1. Design of your framework\r\n2. Code quality\r\n3. Code clarity\r\n4. Wording of your tests\r\n5. How easily we can run the tests\r\n6. Documentation\r\n\r\nIf you are invited for an interview then you will be required to walk the interviewers through your code and you may be required to make some modifications to your framework as part of the interview.\r\n\r\n#Languages\r\n\r\nWe would prefer that you use C# because at Microlise we use C# in building test automation frameworks.\r\n\r\n#Test frameworks\r\n\r\nThe most common style of test framework that we use is BDD(cucumber). Bonus points if you use this.\r\n\r\n#Documentation\r\n\r\nYou should provide complete instructions on how to run your tests, and note any pre requisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README. The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.\r\n\r\n#Submission\r\n\r\nCreate a public repository on github with your code and send us the link OR you can use onedrive, google drive etc. to send us your code and instructions.",
