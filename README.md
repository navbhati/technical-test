Microlise ATD test

##Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to do the Microlise ATD test. Experts in mobile asset and resource optimisation, Microliseâ€™s mission is to empower our customers to reduce their costs and environmental impact by maximising the efficiency of their transportation operations.  To achieve this we will continue to develop and deploy innovative, industry-leading technology solutions and services that enable our customers to optimise fleet utilisation and driver performance, to reduce costs and to improve service delivery. As you can imagine, the user journeys must always be functional and we need to ensure that they are working on every check in of the code.

We would like you to take a look at the Microlise website. You can find it here: 
http://www.microlise.com/

Using a test framework of your choice, in C#, write three tests that you think provide the best coverage of the functionality that is possible in 3 tests. 

If you have any questions regarding this test, please raise an issue against this repo, and one of the team will answer your query as soon as possible.

When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:

Design of your framework
Code quality
Code clarity
Wording of your tests
How easily we can run the tests
Documentation

If you are invited for an interview then you will be required to walk the interviewers through your code and you may be required to make some modifications to your framework as part of the interview.

##Languages

You may use any language of your choice. We would prefer that you use a language that will help you show off your skills in building test automation frameworks, rather than one that you are unfamiliar with.

The language we use at Microlise for test automation is C# and javascript.

##Test frameworks

The two most common styles of test framework that we use are Specification by Example(rspec) and BDD(cucumber). Bonus points if you use these.

##Documentation

You should provide complete instructions on how to run your tests, and note any pre requisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README. The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.

##Submission

Create a public repository on github with your code and send us the link.
